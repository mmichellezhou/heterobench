```cpp
void popcount_optimized(DigitType diff, int* popcount_result)
{
    // On modern Intel CPUs (like the Intel Xeon Gold 6248R specified),
    // the most efficient way to compute the population count (number of set bits)
    // is to utilize the dedicated POPCNT instruction. This instruction is a scalar
    // instruction, operating on a single integer operand, and is distinct from
    // vectorization (SIMD) which operates on multiple data elements simultaneously
    // using XMM/YMM/ZMM registers.
    //
    // The __builtin_popcountll intrinsic (available in GCC and Clang compilers)
    // provides a direct way to leverage the POPCNT instruction for unsigned long long
    // (or equivalent 64-bit unsigned integer types like DigitType).
    // This significantly reduces the number of CPU cycles compared to the
    // software-based SWAR algorithm, leading to substantial performance improvement.
    //
    // The original code's final mask `& 0x7f` is redundant for a 64-bit popcount
    // as the maximum possible count is 64, which is less than 127 (0x7f).
    // __builtin_popcountll correctly returns the full count, which will always
    // be within the range [0, 64] for a 64-bit input, thus fitting within 0x7f.
    *popcount_result = __builtin_popcountll(diff);
    return;
