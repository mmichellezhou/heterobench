This instruction is a scalar\n    // instruction, operating on a single integer operand, and is distinct from\n    // vectorization (SIMD) which operates on multiple data elements simultaneously\n    // using XMM/YMM/ZMM registers.\n    //\n    // The __builtin_popcountll intrinsic (available in GCC and Clang compilers)\n    // provides a direct way to leverage the POPCNT instruction for unsigned long long\n    // (or equivalent 64-bit unsigned integer types like DigitType).\n    // This significantly reduces the number of CPU cycles compared to the\n    // software-based SWAR algorithm, leading to substantial performance improvement.\n    //\n    // The original code's final mask `& 0x7f` is redundant for a 64-bit popcount\n    // as the maximum possible count is 64, which is less than 127 (0x7f).\n    // __builtin_popcountll correctly returns the full count, which will always\n    // be within the range [0, 64] for a 64-bit input, thus fitting within 0x7f.\n    *popcount_result = __builtin_popcountll(diff);\n    return;\n}\n```",
