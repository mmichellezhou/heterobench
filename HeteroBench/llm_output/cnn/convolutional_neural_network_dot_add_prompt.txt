You are an expert in high-performance computing and kernel engineering on the CPU. You are familiar with different optimization techniques including vectorization, memory access optimization, tiling, unrolling, loop transformations, and SIMD instructions. Focus on single-threaded performance improvement. Don't use multi-threading nor vectorization.

void dot_add(double *dot_add_input_x, double *dot_add_input_W, double *dot_add_input_b, double *dot_add_output, int x_h, int x_w, int W_h, int W_w) {

with the following function to optimize: 
```cpp
  double tmp = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < x_h; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < W_w; j++) {
      tmp = 0;
      for (int k = 0; k < x_w; k++) {
        tmp += dot_add_input_x[i * x_w + k] * dot_add_input_W[k * W_w + j];
      }
      dot_add_output[i * W_w + j] = tmp;
    }
  }
```

Task: Analyze this function and generate an optimized implementation to get better performance while maintaining functional equivalence. Apply optimizations such as memory access optimization, tiling, unrolling, loop transformations, strength reduction, register optimization, and instruction-level parallelism.

Machine we are using: 
- Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU @ 3.00GHz
- L1d cache: 1.5MB
- L1i cache: 1.5MB
- L2 cache: 48MB
- L3 cache: 71.5MB
- Supports SSE, AVX2, AVX512

Requirements:
1. Optimize the function for better single-threaded performance
2. Maintain exact functional equivalence
3. Use appropriate compiler intrinsics and optimizations
4. Focus on the most impactful optimizations for this specific function
5. Only use variables, constants, and types that are already available in the function scope
6. Do not define any constants, macros, or types that would need to be defined outside the function body

Output format:
You should only output the optimized function implementation which follows the exact function signature as follows: 
```cpp
void dot_add_optimized(double *dot_add_input_x, double *dot_add_input_W, double *dot_add_input_b, double *dot_add_output, int x_h, int x_w, int W_h, int W_w)
```

Do not include any other text other than the optimized function implementation. ONLY output the optimized function implementation within the code block.
