```cpp
FeatureType Sigmoid_optimized(FeatureType exponent) 
{
  // The Sigmoid function is defined as 1.0f / (1.0f + expf(-exponent)).
  // For single-threaded scalar floating-point operations with strict
  // "exact functional equivalence" and "no vectorization" constraints,
  // the opportunities for manual optimization are extremely limited.
  //
  // The 'expf' function from the standard library (libm) is typically
  // highly optimized for the target architecture, often leveraging
  // specific CPU instructions or highly tuned polynomial approximations
  // while adhering to IEEE 754 precision requirements.
  //
  // Direct replacement of 'expf' with a custom approximation (e.g.,
  // polynomial, lookup table) would violate the "exact functional equivalence"
  // requirement due to differences in precision and rounding.
  //
  // The arithmetic operations (negation, addition, division) are also
  // handled very efficiently by modern compilers, which will schedule
  // them for optimal instruction-level parallelism and utilize FPU capabilities.
  //
  // Given the constraints, the most computationally intensive part is 'expf'.
  // While there are no standard C++ intrinsics that provide a faster, *exact*
  // 'expf' implementation, some compilers (like GCC/Clang) offer built-in functions
  // (e.g., __builtin_expf) that correspond to standard library functions.
  // Using __builtin_expf explicitly can sometimes allow the compiler
  // more flexibility in optimization (e.g., inlining for constant arguments,
  // or using specific hardware instructions if available and precise enough),
  // though for general variable inputs, it often resolves to the same libm call.
  // This is a minor, compiler-specific hint that adheres to the "compiler intrinsics"
  // requirement without violating "exact functional equivalence" or "no vectorization".
  //
  // No other loop transformations, tiling, unrolling, or memory access
  // optimizations are applicable as this is a scalar function without loops or arrays.
  // Strength reduction is not applicable to expf or the division in a way
  // that maintains exact equivalence and improves performance.
  // Register optimization is handled by the compiler.

  return 1.0f / (1.0f + __builtin_expf(-exponent));
